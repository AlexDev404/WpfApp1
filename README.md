# Proof-Of-Concept: Pure C++ WPF Application

This application is in pure C++/CLR.
This application is not perfect but just goes to show that you can write a WPF application without having to use C#.
This application reads off of a XAML file in memory, and displays it. Interactions and events are fully possible.
